# BST construction

Average Time: O(log(N)) | Worst Time: O(log(N))

**Recursive(递归):**
Average Space: O(log(N)) | Worst Space: O(N)
**Iterative(迭代):**
Average Space: O(1) | Worst Space: O(1)

Think about the edge cases:

1. whether subtree exists

2. whether is root

3. Combine 1 and 2 cases together.
